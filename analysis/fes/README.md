With these scripts, a user can generate free energy maps for two scenarios:

1. The script provides a way to plot a 2D histogram of a negative log joint distribution of two variables of interest.
2. Also, a way to plot a 2D contour of a negative log joint distribution of two variables overlayed with normalized histogram of a third variable observed for those two variables.
